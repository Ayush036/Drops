# Drops-
Drops is a rain prediction web API which helps you in predicting whether or not it will rain tomorrow. The whole project is built on a machine learning model that takes account of several factors in order to predict rainfall. The Data that has been used is of Australia which tells us a lot about the climatic conditions over there based on different regions and topologies. Since global warming, the patterns in rainfall across the globe have changed drastically hence relying on one model won't suffice in the long run. Creating future scope for this project where with the help of live data streaming the model will keep evolving and give even better results.
